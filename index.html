                class during my sophomore year. The teacher told us that the course was self-paced, so I got the freedom to learn 
                things that were not in the class curriculum.</br>
                More often, I stay busy with my school and extracurricular work. But you can find me traveling the world, 
                playing with my dogs, or camping with my family when I have some spare time.

              <div class="media-caption news-caption">During my junior year of high school, I managed the academic magnet wrestling team, spending 76 hours on both practices and matches. 
                My job was to ensure the team functioned well and matches went smoothly. During most events, there was one match on one mat at a time, 
                and 2-3 schools were present. However, there were also invitationals, which meant more than ten teams and 3-4 mats had matches simultaneously. 
                I was in charge of tracking our teams' results (and their future competitors' results for comparisons) on brackets and ensuring each member knew 
                when it was almost their turn and when they should start warming up. In standard matches, I sat close to the mat with a scorebook to track each 
                point earned and lost. In both invitationals and basic matches, I was often asked to video record certain matches, and it was important to show my 
                support for each participant. During practices, my job was to keep track of everyone's weight, results, and specific points earned/lost from everyone's 
                matches throughout the season, as well as help with drills and keeping time.

          <p class="cat"><em><b>Categories:</b> Extracurricular, Leadership</em></p>
          <div class="media-caption news-caption">I’ve played violin for ten years and participated in regional and All-State Orchestras since 2018. 
            I came to the School of the Arts for violin in sixth grade and successfully auditioned for SOA’s High school Symphony orchestra, which I played in until 
            I moved up to Sinfonietta Junior year. 
            At the end of my Junior year, I traveled to Orlando, Florida, as a section leader of the second violins of the Sinfonietta ensemble. 
            We participated in a National competition called the NOF (National Orchestra Festival) and won grand champions.
             I was a part of the District Orchestra from 2015 to 2018, where I became concertmaster ( the leading first violinist that all orchestra sections follow). 
            From 2021 - 2023, I participated in a chamber music Charleston program(CMC), alternating between first and second violin parts.
            In March of 2022, as a member of the quintet, I participated in a masterclass conducted by the world-renowned Midori Goto.
            At the end of March 2022, my quintet participated in USC Chamber Music Day, where we received two individual two-hour-long coachings 
            and a masterclass from USC staff and members of the Parker Quartet.
            I grew in a new way, mainly when I played my first violin, because of the soloistic part and the type of leadership it takes to keep 
            the five-person ensemble together. Communication is unique when it comes to chamber music. In rehearsals, you must comment on everyones 
            playing to improve the group’s sound, and this has to be done in a polite, direct, and effective manner so the players can understand 
            your point quickly and incorporate it into their playing.</div>

            and two assessments, volunteers are matched with children who share similar interests and are either a student in Ukraine or a student in a neighboring 
            country that has had to evacuate from Ukraine. It's the volunteers' job to set up meetings and lead the conversations. I learned English as a second 
            language and had to take extra classes and evaluations throughout elementary school to track my progress, so I see the value of the English language 
            on an international scale. Expressing my support for Ukraine in my now strongest subject has been a very fulfilling opportunity.</div>

            My mom and I decided to build a stage, set up lights and a fog machine, and play Halloween music over a speaker when I wanted to take a break 
            from playing songs on my violin. 
            Kids of all ages enjoyed our setup, and it equally entertained parents. Still making sure we followed COVID precautions, of course, it was a 
            great way to keep the holiday for children while adjusting for everyone's safety.

            True Italian cuisine has always been my favorite. After experiencing the thin flimsy pizza, pasta like spaghetti 
            alle vongole and Nero di sepia, salads, and prosciutto there was no way for me to live at home without it and stay satisfied. 
            So my mom and I would buy all sorts of Italian cookbooks to replicate my favorite meals and more. It wasn't long before 
            we started experimenting with food from other cultures. Now one typical lunch I bring to school is onigiri, sauerkraut, 
            Caprese salad, and fruits (all homemade).</div>
